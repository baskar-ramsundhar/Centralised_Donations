# Donation Platform Architecture

## Overview

The donation platform will be a centralized hub for managing recurring contributions to vetted non-profit organizations. It will simplify the donation process with a user-friendly interface and secure payment handling via Stripe Connect.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing user, organization, and donation data)
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe Connect (Destination Charges model)
- **Development Environment**: Project IDX
- **Deployment**: Vercel (for Next.js applications)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## System Architecture

The platform will follow a modern web application architecture with the following components:

### 1. Frontend Layer

- **Public Pages**: Landing page, organization discovery, about, FAQ
- **Donor Dashboard**: Profile management, donation history, recurring donation management
- **Organization Dashboard**: Profile management, donation analytics, payout history
- **Admin Dashboard**: Organization verification, platform management, analytics

### 2. API Layer (Next.js API Routes)

- **Authentication API**: User registration, login, password reset
- **Organization API**: Organization CRUD, verification status
- **Donation API**: Process donations, manage recurring donations
- **Stripe Connect API**: Handle Stripe Connect integration, webhooks
- **Analytics API**: Generate reports for donors and organizations

### 3. Database Layer

MongoDB will store the following collections:
- Users (donors, organization admins, platform admins)
- Organizations (non-profits)
- Donations (one-time and recurring)
- Subscriptions (recurring donation details)
- Payouts (to organizations)
- Categories (for organization classification)

### 4. External Services

- **Stripe Connect**: Payment processing, subscription management, connected accounts
- **Email Service**: Transactional emails, receipts, notifications
- **File Storage**: Organization logos, documentation

## Data Flow

1. **Donation Flow**:
   - Donor selects organization and donation amount
   - Platform creates a charge on the platform account
   - Platform transfers funds to the organization's connected account (minus platform fee)
   - Platform sends receipt to donor and notification to organization

2. **Recurring Donation Flow**:
   - Donor sets up recurring donation with frequency and amount
   - Platform creates a subscription using Stripe Connect
   - On each billing cycle, platform processes payment and transfers funds
   - Platform sends receipts and updates donation history

3. **Organization Onboarding Flow**:
   - Organization registers and provides required information
   - Platform admin verifies organization
   - Organization connects Stripe account via Stripe Connect
   - Organization becomes available for donations

## Security Considerations

- PCI compliance through Stripe
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Authentication with secure password policies
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Regular security audits

## Scalability Considerations

- Serverless architecture with Next.js API routes
- Database indexing for performance
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Webhook handling for asynchronous processing
- Monitoring and alerting for system health

## Compliance Features

- Tax receipt generation
- Donation history for tax purposes
- Privacy policy and terms of service
- GDPR compliance for user data
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
